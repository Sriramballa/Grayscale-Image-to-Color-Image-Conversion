# Grayscale to Colour Image Conversion

## Description
A deep learning-based system that converts grayscale images into realistic colored images using CNNs.
The model learns color distribution from training images and predicts chrominance channels.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- CNN (Autoencoder)

## Applications
- Historical image restoration
- Medical imaging enhancement
- Old photo recoloring

## Role
Team Leader – Designed architecture, training pipeline, and inference system.
